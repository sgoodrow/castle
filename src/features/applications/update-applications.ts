‚ùì **What do volunteers do?**
‚Ä¢ Read about each [volunteer role](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19fqGGGAW3tXTPb8syiCZQZED9qTGhY65dnaWL8YzZnE).

‚ùì **What's expected of volunteers?**
‚Ä¢ Represent us well, both internally and externally.
‚Ä¢ Commit as much time as you like, when you'd like.
‚Ä¢ You may take a break or step down at any time, but you will be required to re-apply if you become interested again.

‚ùì **Am I a good candidate to volunteer? What if I'm an ally?**
‚Ä¢ Yes! Everyone is encouraged to volunteer.
‚Ä¢ All roles are open to alliance members except :red_square: **Officer** and :red_square: **Guard**, which are Castle-members only.

üìú **How do I apply?**

‚Ä¢ Retrieving the application is not a commitment to apply!
