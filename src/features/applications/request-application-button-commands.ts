  `In Castle, leadership is a voluntary service with no compensation or special privileges. Officers are tasked with running the guild. Officers may step down at any time.

**How do I apply to be an Officer?**
Send a Discord message to any Officer with your answers to the following questions.

**Officer Application**
>  1. Please describe what motivates you to volunteer as an officer.
>  
>  2. Officers must set a shining example for the other members of the guild. This may include moderating our typical habits of speech in guild chat, and refraining from trash-talking even when others are rude. Furthermore, we must know the server rules inside and out, and follow them. Our behavior reflects directly upon Castle itself. Are you willing to hold yourself to the highest standards of decorum even during emotional times and to take responsibility for the consequences of your decisions as an officer?
>  
>  3. While we are allowed to play the game and not be on-duty all the time, being an Officer will indeed consume some of one's game time. Are you willing to dedicate some of your game time to being an Officer of Castle? And do you have the wisdom to set aside time for yourself to enjoy the game?
>  
>  4. The complaints and reports we receive are sometimes genuine, but sometimes frivolous or false. We need people who will endure the discomfort of dealing diplomatically with reports and be willing to have honest talks with members, mostly 30-to-60-year-old adults, about their misbehavior in a video game. Do you have the maturity to maintain your composure and behave professionally?

**What happens to an application?**
Officers are voted in by current officers. Each applicant must be approved by 3 current officers and not be opposed by any. This process typically takes a less than a week. Officers are the only players who see applications. Applications and their discussion are deleted permanently once voted on.`,
