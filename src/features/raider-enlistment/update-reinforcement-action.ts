❓ **How do I participate and how do I stop?**
• Use the buttons below to join and leave the reinforcements at will.
• When called upon: if you don't like the loot rules, don't help. Play nice with each other and be fair.

❓ **How do I call for reinforcements?**
• Ping the role when you need help.
• You are responsible for determining fair loot rules and ensuring they are understood by all participants.
• Avoid asking for help during raids and scheduled socks.
• Avoid using for Lodi.
• Avoid using for filling out EXP groups.
• These events cannot involve earning or spending DKP.

❗ **Examples**
> "${role} I won Scout roll and need help. Quest loot is mine, rest /random"

> "${role} Phinny is up, all loot /random"

> "${role} VSR is up. Roll for turn in/stone, other loot /random"`,
