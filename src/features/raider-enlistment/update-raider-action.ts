‚Ä¢ Level 46.5+ for most raids; 52+ for raids beyond Siren's Grotto
‚Ä¢ Read and understand the Castle DKP rules (https://tinyurl.com/rules-castle-dkp)
‚Ä¢ Not raiding with any other guilds
‚Ä¢ Not PvP flagged

üìú **Behaviors**
1. **Be in raid voice.** Listen to raid leader instructions and do not argue with them. Only discuss the raid topics.
2. **Wait for assist.** Use an "/assist Name" macro. Attack only when assist is called to allow tanks to position mobs and enchanters to drain mana to prevent gating/healing.
3. **Arrive 15 minutes early.** Being late delays the raid.
4. **Send tells for buffs, res's and ports.** Do not use /say, /gu, or voice. Sending a /tell allows people to use /rt to target and buff you.
5. **Healers form groups unless RL says otherwise.** Druids, clerics, and shamans pick up LFGs. Send them a tell saying "invited". Everyone else set /lfg on and accept invites.
6. **Keep raid voice clear.** Voice is used by the pull team and raid leaders. Use text for everything you can.
7. **Avoid being AFK.** Don't attend raids you can't be present for. For short AFKs (less than 5 minutes), type /afk and announce it in /say. If you have a critical role (main tank, assist, cleric), say it in voice chat. Make someone else your group leader.
8. **Don't push mobs out of camp.** Melee should attack from the sides, not the back, so the tank stays near healers.
9. **Stand when a mob is incoming.** Sitting generates aggro. Mobs will one-shot sitters and mess up positioning.
10. **Only discuss raid targets in raid voice.** Targets get sniped. Keep our strategy and tactics close to the chest.

‚ùì **How do I join ${this.role}?**
Send a message in this channel with the following information and a Knight will give you the role.

1. Include a screenshot of your Castle- or alliance- tagged character with their name, guild and level visible. Also include /time in the chat.
2. Include a link to your CastleDKP.com raiding character profile (NOT the MyCharacters page). Please use first name only for your character.
3. Say **"I have read and agree to follow the raider requirements and behaviors."**

‚ùì **What if I don't follow the required raider requirements or behaviors?**
Leadership will DM you with a reminder warning, then a 1 DKP penalty, followed by a 1-week suspension, and finally dismissal from raider status.

Periodically the ${this.role} roster will be reviewed, and if you have been inactive for more than three months (ie: not attended a raid tick), then you will be converted from "Raider" to "Inactive Raider".  You can request reactivation by posting in this channel. All DKP will be maintained.`,
